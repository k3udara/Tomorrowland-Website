                    <p>Working together with other people for a project can be a challenging task in some cases but luckily, 
                    we worked well with group members. The decisions we made were anonymous although we paced ourselves individually 
                    when it came to completing our separate tasks. As a group, we believe that we connected well on an interpersonal 
                    level as all four of us were able to make alterations to any problem together. There was an equal divide in the 
                    amount of work that we all did; our contributions were fair and no one was lacking behind.This project is a
                    great oppotunity for us to make better connections with eachother.
